    <h1>THIS IS THE AGE ... OF A NEW DAWN</h1>
    <h5> come here to motivate, leave here to change the world</h5>
    
    <p> when you walk out of those doors you have two choices, love or fear - choose <strong>LOVE </strong> and don't ever let fear turn you against your playful heart - Jim Carrey</p>
    <p> I must not <em>fear</em>. Fear is the mind killer. Fear is the little death that brings total obliteration. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past, I will turn the inner eye to see it's path. Where the fear has gone, there will be nothing. <Strong>Only I will remain</Strong></p>
    <h5> you must continue, <em>Jackson Cage</em>. </h5>
    <!--this isn't scary, at all - rather it's quite enjoyable-->
